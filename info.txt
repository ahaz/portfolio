I am a graduate of IIT Kharagpur, where I hold both a bachelor's and a master's degree, and I am currently pursuing a second master's with a dissertation focused on human-computer interaction at the University of Glasgow. My expertise spans orchestration platforms, machine learning, computer vision, and image processing, evidenced by a patent, an IEEE research paper, and my thesis in related projects during my bachelor's. With 5 years of experience in cloud migration and management platforms at IBM and Kyndryl, my academic excellence and versatile contributions make me an exceptional candidate for your team.
